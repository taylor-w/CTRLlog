# CTRLlog

## Overview

In addition to a '.gitignore' and some VS Code specific extensions and settings, it includes the 'recommended' settings for:

1. [ESLint](eslint.org)
2. [Stylelint](stylelint.io)
3. [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)

Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) is also included along with appropriate extensions.

## Why CTRLlog

**Jounraling** is becoming more of a lost pastime as society speeds up and moves towards becoming paperless. Many studies, including this one from the [University of Rochester](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentID=4552&ContentTypeID=1) speak on the importance of journaling for mental health.

**CTRLlog** aims to keep intact with the modern paperless pursuit, while preserving the human need for writing and expressing day to day activities and emotions.
